# Changelog

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **`summarize_activity` MCP tool** — Server-side activity summarization. Joins sessions, hints, and session markers, groups by workstream, returns pre-formatted markdown. Replaces multi-call client-side assembly in `/relay:summarize`.

### Changed
- **`/relay:summarize` skill** — Simplified to a single `summarize_activity` MCP call + pass-through. No more manual session listing, hint fetching, marker reading, or client-side grouping.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Empty registry crash** — `session-start.sh` incorrectly hit the "multiple active workstreams" path when no workstreams existed. Caused by `grep -c . || echo "0"` producing a multiline value (`"0\n0"`) that failed integer comparison.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Multi-instance support** — Multiple workstreams can be active simultaneously. Run separate Claude Code instances (e.g., one per git worktree) each attached to a different workstream without conflicts.
- **`attach-workstream.sh`** — New script that binds a session to a workstream (writes marker + loads state) in one step. Warns if another live session is using the same workstream.

### Changed
- **`session-start.sh`** — Detects 0, 1, or 2+ active workstreams. Single active auto-attaches (unchanged). Multiple active lists them and asks the user to pick.
- **`session-end.sh`** — Uses session marker (not `status == "active"`) to find this session's workstream.
- **`pre-compact-save.sh`** — Uses session marker (not `status == "active"`) to find this session's workstream.
- **`switch-registry.sh`** — Only activates the target workstream. No longer parks the old one.
- **`/relay:new`** — No longer auto-parks other active workstreams. New workstream created alongside existing active ones.
- **`/relay:switch`** — Detaches from current workstream and attaches to target. Both stay active. Use `/relay:park` to explicitly deactivate.
- **`/relay:status`** — Shows attached workstream and lists other active workstreams.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Session ID availability** — `session-start.sh` now outputs the session ID as `relay-session-id:` in context, so skills can reliably reference it for hint file naming. Previously referenced a nonexistent `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` environment variable.
- **Hint UUID validation** — Indexer now rejects hint files with truncated session IDs (must be full 36-char UUIDs). Prevents silent data loss from malformed backfill output.

### Changed
- **Skills** — Save, park, switch, and pre-compact instructions updated to read session ID from context instead of env var.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Session hints** — Write-time metadata for efficient summarization. Claude writes small JSON hint files at save/park/switch/compact time. The MCP server indexes them into a `session_hints` table for fast assembly. Reduces summarize token cost by 10x+.
- **`get_session_summaries` MCP tool** — Fetches pre-written session summaries from the database in one query. Returns structured segments with summary bullets and decisions.
- **`/relay:backfill` skill** — Generate session hints for older sessions interactively. Reads conversations and writes structured summaries as a one-time cost.

### Changed
- **`/relay:summarize`** — Now reads pre-written hints instead of fetching full conversation content. Sessions without hints degrade gracefully to metadata-only entries.
- **`/relay:save`, `/relay:park`, `/relay:switch`** — Now write session hint files after saving state.
- **PreCompact hook** — Now instructs Claude to write a session hint before context compression.
- **Indexer** — Scans `session-hints/` directory on startup and indexes hint files into `session_hints` table.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **`/relay:idea` skill** — Capture ideas for future work (`/relay:idea <text>`), displayed as a separate section in `/relay:list`. Promote an idea to a full workstream with `/relay:idea promote <id>`. Ideas stored in `ideas.json`.
- **`/relay:summarize` skill** — Summarize recent activity grouped by workstream. Supports natural-language time ranges (`48h`, `7d`, `since Monday`, ISO dates). Useful for standup prep, brag books, and catching up after time away.
- **Cross-project indexing docs** — README now clarifies that the search index covers all projects globally, with `project` parameter for narrowing results.

### Changed
- **`/relay:list`** — Now displays ideas as a separate section between workstreams and parking lot.
- **`/relay:new`** — Auto-detects matching ideas and offers to remove them when creating a workstream.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Session-level addressing** — Three tool enhancements for navigating multi-session conversations:
  - `get_conversation` accepts `session` parameter to filter to specific sessions (e.g. `"4"`, `"2-3"`, `"1,4"`)
  - `list_sessions` accepts `slug` parameter, returns session index with `session_number` fields
  - `search_history` results include `session_number` showing position in slug chain

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Renamed project from context-flow to relay** — avoids autocomplete collision with Claude Code's built-in `/context` command
- **Centralized app name** — new `scripts/common.sh` with shared `APP_NAME`, `DATA_DIR`, and `COUNTER_PREFIX` constants sourced by all 13 scripts
- **Python package renamed** — `context_flow_server` → `relay_server`, `context-flow-server` → `relay-server`
- **MCP server renamed** — `context-flow-search` → `relay-search`
- **Data paths updated** — `~/.config/context-flow/` → `~/.config/relay/`, `~/.local/share/context-flow/` → `~/.local/share/relay/`
- **All slash commands** — `/context-flow:*` → `/relay:*`

### Added
- **`scripts/migrate-data.sh`** — one-time migration script to move data from old `context-flow` paths to `relay`
- **Old directory detection** — `session-start.sh` detects `~/.config/context-flow/` and prompts user to run migration

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **`write-data-file.sh`** — generic helper script to write files to the data directory from stdin, eliminating `$DATA_DIR` and `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-...}` permission prompts on writes

### Changed
- **All skills** (switch, save, park, new) — removed `## Data directory` section; all file reads use `read-data-file.sh`, all writes use `write-data-file.sh`. Claude no longer constructs `$DATA_DIR` paths inline, eliminating "Command contains ${} parameter substitution" and "Shell expansion syntax in paths" permission prompts.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **`read-data-file.sh`** — generic helper script to read files from the data directory, eliminating `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-...}` parameter substitution prompts

### Changed
- **List skill** — uses `read-data-file.sh` instead of inline `$DATA_DIR` with `${}`-based default, removing permission prompts
- **README copyediting** — clarified wording in intro, tag filtering example, and migration section

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-26

Security hardening, architecture improvements, and workflow polish based on security + architecture reviews.

### Added
- **Test suite** — 49 tests across 5 files (db, tagger, formatter, indexer, server)
- **`complete-save.sh`** — single script for state file rotation, registry update, and counter reset
- **Helper scripts** — `update-registry.sh`, `switch-registry.sh`, `park-registry.sh`, `new-registry.sh`, `reset-counter.sh` to avoid inline jq/for in skills (which triggered permission prompts)
- **Permission pattern docs** in README — recommended `Bash(bash */context-flow/*/scripts/*:*)` for frictionless saves
- **Update instructions** in README
- **Schema versioning** — `workstreams.json` includes `"version": 1` for future migrations
- **Dev dependencies** — `pytest>=8.0` as optional dependency

### Changed
- **Context monitor resets on save/switch/park** — counter goes to 0 after saving, stopping repeated warnings
- **`command mv` everywhere** — bypasses shell `mv -i` aliases without the aggressive `-f` flag
- **`auto_tag_session` optimization** — only fetches `tool_summary` + `plan` roles instead of all messages
- **MCP dependency pinned** — `mcp[cli]>=1.0.0,<2.0.0` to prevent breaking changes
- **Skills use script calls** — all registry operations go through helper scripts instead of inline shell commands

### Security
- **DB directory permissions** — created with `mode=0o700`
- **`PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`** — enforced on every connection
- **UUID validation** — regex check at all trust boundaries (hooks + indexer) to prevent path traversal
- **Workstream name validation** — `[a-z0-9-]` enforced in shell scripts
- **FTS5 error handling** — `sqlite3.OperationalError` caught with helpful syntax hint
- **Input bounds** — limit clamping (`MAX_LIMIT=500`), tag count/length limits, format/scope parameter validation
- **Type hints** — `callable` → `Callable` from `collections.abc`
